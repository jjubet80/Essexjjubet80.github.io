						<!-- <p><strong>Reflection on NISM module</strong><br><br>

							This module focused on Network and Information Security Management. There were alot of practical activities and discussion forums in this module which focused basically on network vulnerability identification, penetration testing, data breaches and protection and network security management<br><br>
							
							There were teams set up for most of the practical Exercises performed. I was part of the group 2 which comprised of Elizabeth Cook, Isioma Vina Tolofari, Samuel Osoradion Tolofari and Myself. There were other groups 1 and 3. In the first group meeting, we asked Elizabeth Cook to lead the group since we wanted a coordinated activity.<br><br>
							
							The first Exercise was a discussion forum in Unit 1 of the module that highlight the vulnerabilities in a medical training Mannequin exploited using Brute force attacks and Denial of Service attack.<br><br>
							
							The second Exercise was a group Exercise on STRIDE & DREAD tools presented in Seminar 1. STRIDE is a threat model technique developed by Microsoft and stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Elevation of Privilege while DREAD is a risk assessment tool to help measure the risk of the threats identified. DREAD stands for Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users and Discoverability. The compromised medical mannequin in Unit 1 was the topic used to evaluate STRIDE and DREAD.<br><br>
							
							The Third Exercise was a Team activity. The team was tasked with a practical Scanning Exercise in Unit 3 to use available tools like traceroute and whois to find administrative information on an allocated website allmytype.ac.uk. A discussion forum set up to discuss the results for each group.<br><br>
							
							A seminar was done on Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP? And in the discussion, I submited my opinion that the internet is better with the OSI model since it has more elaborate layers and seems to have more focus on security. Other Teams also submitted similar views in support of the OSI.<br><br>
							
							Another interesting Team exercise was the design document submitted in Unit 6 and 11. we identified governing bodies for the website allocated (blog site allmytype.ac.uk), possible security vulnerabilities and mitigation. In Unit 8 we also reviewed the standard applicable to the website which is GDPR.<br><br> 
							
							My research on vulnerabilities was basically based on the OWASP top 10 website vulnerabilities. This is because OWASP is a non profit organization with decades of experience and whose aim is to research was on improving web site security(Imperva.com, N.D).<br><br>
							
							There was a discussion forum on GDPR related case studies. I chose a case study relating to missing evidence and highlighted the implication as a breach of the GDPR Art 32.  Breach checklist was also prepared and presented at a seminar<br><br>
							
							Unit 11 also highlighted several future trends in the internet in which our group discussed the peer-to-peer overlay-based networking as a future trend. This was a group Exercise. Each member presented his argument and it is clear that the trend tends to address certain deficiencies of the current system architectures.<br><br>
							
							The scanning exercise in Unit 3 was quite interesting as there were some arguments on the exact location of the A2hosting web servers. Group 1 team noted that the server was located at Amsterdam while my group noted that it was located at USA. It was quite an interesting exercise that gave me an indept knowledge of a scanning Exercise. With the Experience I now have, I would say that it is quite challenging to determine the physical location of these devices especially with the advent of technologies like software defined networks (SDN) and virtual technologies<br><br>
							
							The discussion on medical mannequin compromise made me realize that so many IoT devices where design with capabilities to connect to the Internet without considering the inherent danger of cyber attacks. The need for secured systems in this modern day cannot be over emphasized especially with medical equipment since these may endanger human life.<br><br>
							
							
							After reading other data breach case studies from some of my colleagues, I was particularly worried at the level of negligence to data privacy. One case that baffled me was that which was posted by Vina Tolofari of a situation were a delay Tactics was used to deny access to a CCTV footage on the ground of loss of data due to retention policy. In my opinion, this shows that the GDPR regulations are greatly undermined and privacy issue are not taken seriously. Perhaps, more stringent sanctions or a review of the GDPR regulations will change the narrative.<br><br>
							
							The discussion forums have been very Engaging. I realise its not just about writing what you know. There is alot of critically in those discussion forums and alot of research has to be done. The feeling that what I am writing may not make a logical sense to my other colleagues, make me want to explore more ideas and scrutinize my submissions in the forums.<br><br>
							
							
							The breach checklist prepared as a group exercise in UNIT 10 is a very useful tool since it maps out important requirements and steps to monitor compliance to the GDPR data breach policy. What I also think is necessary is regular training on completing this breach checklist using different scenarios will expose data processors on how to effectively use this breach checklist<br><br>
							
							For the STRIDE & DREAD tools, I have a little reservation to the STRIDE threat modelling because it is quite and old technique and with the changing landscape in cyber attacks and rapidly emerging threats, I am not comfortable adopting it as a threat modelling Technique. The DREAD analysis also appears to be a concern to me because while we were deliberating as a group on how we access the risk, I became conscious of the possibility of these ratings to be subjective and also immature. I wasn’t too comfortable with the ratings because I felt I might have a different opinion at the end of the course after I have mastered the course and learned other aspects of Risk.<br><br>
							
							The module was full of practical activities which I must admit there was a little bit of inexperience in this kind of activity however, I am certain that performing this kind of activity over and over again will eventually make me outstanding. This is the kind of activity I like as I prefer more practical activities than theoretical exercise.<br><br>

							<h5><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></h5>
							<ol>
								<li>Identify relevant academic literature which discusses the ways in which secure software may be developed using an agile process.</li>
								<li> Decompose an activity into a set of tasks which can be represented using a flow chart from the UML portfolio of modelling techniques.</li>
								<li>Describe the importance of creating a culture of risk awareness in an organization, in addition to the creation of secure software.</li>
							</ol>
							
						

				<p>This module focused on the Security aspect of Software development. In this Unit, the concept of Secured 
					 design was introduced. This started by discussing the various approaches to Software design as well as the 
					 Architecture of software design. The modelling processes are also discussed and a Learning discussion forum 
					 was introduced on UML flowchart.
					</p> 


					<P>The OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project) is a collection of independent software and security experts 
						with a mandate to improve the software Security. Renowned information technology companies like Panasonic, 
						Accenture and Allstate are participating members of this Project. OWAPS Identified 10 top software security
						 weaknesses as Broken Access Control, Cryptographic Failures, Injection, Insecure Design, Security 
						 Misconfiguration, Vulnerable and Outdated Components, Identification and Authentication Failures, Software 
						 and Data Integrity Failures, Security Logging and Monitoring Failures and Server-Side Request Forgery 
						 (Owasp.org, 2021). also Identified by OWASP is the Top 10 Proactive controls; Define security requirements, 
						 Leverage security frameworks and libraries, Secure database access, Encode and escape data, Validate all inputs,
						  Implement digital identity, Enforce access controls, Protect data everywhere, Implement security logging and
						  Implement digital identity, Enforce access controls, Protect data everywhere, Implement security logging and
						   monitoring and Handle all errors and exceptions(<a href="http://owasp.org">Owasp.org</a>, n.d.).
						</p>

					<p>
						The software development Life Cycle has two approaches; The predictive and the Adaptive Approach. Waterfall Model is a predictive approach while the Agile model is an Adaptive approach. Security issues with the Waterfall model is its in ability to accommodate immediate changes, user and client inputs and delay in Testing. Security issue with the Agile Model is the pressure it suffers from demand for a working programme at each stage of the process which leads to inadequate testing. Information security knowledge may also be missing throughout the process as emphasis is on quality and suitability

					</p>

					<p>
						The Architecture of a system is the fundamental Organisation of its components and the relationship with each other as well as its environment, stakeholders and the principle guiding its design and evolution(<a href="http://web.archive.org">web.archive.org</a>, 2011). The TOGAF was designed by the Open group and has been used by most organizations as their Architecture framework. This framework is a 10 phase process.
					</p>

					<p>The TOGAF is now modified with SABSA following a critism that it fails to address security in its framework.
					</p>


					<p>Design patterns are used to describe in an organised format, how the code will proffer solutions to the frequently identified software engineering problems. This is structured as a Creational Factory,Structural Adapter,  Behavioral Mediator. Antipatterns come in when the pattern considered appropriate solution to a problem does not exist</p>

					<p>The Unified Modelling Language(UML) provides information or describes the process towards the development of the solution in a graphical language. UML consists of classifiers, Event and Behaviors. The classifiers define the set of objects which usually have a common feature. The Event describes the occurrences within the identified system and the behaviours describe the kinetics and reactions to these Events. Examples of UML diagrams are Use cases, Sequence Diagrams, Class Diagrams and Activity Diagrams. UMLs enable communication during the software development life cycle</p>

							<h5><strong>Learning outcomes</strong></h5>
							<ol>
								<li>Describe some key milestones in the development of programming languages.</li>
								<li> Outline some of the key paradigms that define the different types of languages.</li>
								<li>Explain the key concepts that determine the operation of programming languages.</li>
								<li>Discuss key programming challenges and recommended best practices.</li>
								<li>Explain what design patterns are and when to use them.</li>
				
							</ol>
							  
							<p>
								Programming Languages are languages prepared by humans to enable communication with computer systems. A programming language is made abstract to make it easier for humans to create programs that affect outcomes on computing devices.

Although programming languages are readable by humans, they are not directly executed in the computer but are transformed into machine native code.  There are 2 approaches to this conversion; either via compilers or Interpreter.

							</p>
						
						<p>
							A compiler takes as input that is the source program written in the programming language and converts it to a machine readable program called the Target program all at once. The Interpreter does this one statement at a time. Modern programming languages like Java and C# are however a hybrid of these systems.

						</p>
					
					<p>
						Agile comes with a manisfesto which focus on individuals and interactions instead of process and tools, Working product instead of Comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration instead of Contract Negotiations, Responding to change instaed of following a plan. Models include  DSDM (dynamic systems development method), RUP (the rational unified process)
					</p>

					<p>
						Programming Paradigms are classified as imperative( programs are structured sequentially, Functional(based on evaluation and expression of math formulas), Logical(Artificial intelligence), Object Oriented(Uses abstractions).
					</p>

					<p>
						There are several concepts used to describe programming languages. These concepts are based on the following terminologies; Abstraction, Casting, Encapsulation, Garbage collection, Grammar, Inheritance, Mutability, Pointers, Polymorphism, Queues, Recursion, Regex, Stacks and Syntax. Python is one programming language that can be used to describe these concepts. Python is designed to be an easily readable and has found more users because of it is easy to understand by beginners.
					</p>

					<p>
						Software testing is important to avoid failures. Validation and verification is used in software testing. Whitebox and blackbox approach can be used in software testing. In whitebox approach, the tester knows the instructions of the code while in blackbox approach, it is not known to the tester.Whitebox is basically used for internal system testing eg unit testing while blackbox for overall functionality of the system eg equivalence testing. Software testing should be carried out early and throughout the lifecycle. the testing process defined by the ISO/IEC/IEEE in 29119 Part 4 can be summarised as; identify feature sets, Derive test conditions, Derive test coverage Items, Derive test cases, Assemble test sets, Derive test procedures.
					</p>

					<p>
						Testing types include, functional Testing, Usability testing, compatibility testing, Regression testing, Acceptance Testing, Performance testing, Big bang testing. The major broad  testing types are Vulnerability testing and Penetration testing.
					</p>

					<p>
						The Cyclomatic Complexity can be used to determine how complex our code is.  It involves counting the number of decision points in code. Code complexity increases with the number of decision points. The complexity inturn indicates the more likelihood of errors or problems in the code. Myers' Interval shows how boolean operators are used in much the same way that the more operands used, the more its complexity and also its chance of errors.
