							<p><h5><strong>UNIT 3: Status Report Assignment</strong></h5><br><br>
								<p ><strong> Assignment Brief:</strong><br> Acme Manufacturing is an SME (Small/Medium Enterprise) employing 150 staff. It produces sporks for niche industries and due to increased demand, has decided to purchase an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to allow itself to more flexibly manage its supply chain. With this, the company should be able to scale production up or down to better meet demand.

									<p>The company has shortlisted its selection down to 3 options: </p>

									<ol>
										<li>A COTS (Commercial Off the Shelf) solution provided by a major manufacturer at a purchase cost of $100k. Support costs vary depending on the level required but a basic telephone support-only contract starts at $50k p.a. </li>
										<li>An Open-Source solution that will be installed and supported by their internal IT department, relying on community (forum) support for any escalations.  </li>
										<li>An in-house created solution built by a student as part of her final year project and supported by the developer, as well as the internal IT department.  </li>
										
									</ol>

									<p>Currently, all the resource planning and scheduling are done via spreadsheets and that solution is becoming unwieldy.</p>

									<p>Your team has been retained as IT Risk Consultants with a brief to:</p>

									<ol>
										<li>Create a comprehensive risk assessment and report, recommending which of the three solutions the company should select. You are expected to justify your selection with supporting evidence.  </li>
									<li>Create a Disaster Recovery solution for whichever option you recommend. The company has asked for a Recovery Point Objective of 15 minutes and a Recovery Time Objective of 4 hours. However, their production facility only runs 8 am to 6 pm so the company has asked for your professional recommendations as risk consultants.  </li>
									</ol> 
									
									<p ><strong> Part 1: A Status Report Document </strong></p>
									<p><strong>For this first assessment</strong>, your team is expected to propose an overview of your assumptions and scope of requirements for the organisation in the form of a status report. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid (Module Resources).</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Your project status report should detail your assumptions around the Company's financial status and stability, risk appetite, IT capabilities, and company structure based on research of similar companies. This should come from a literature review of existing organisations of a similar size using similar technologies (such as using excel spreadsheets for resource planning and management, being a small manufacturing company, and similar criteria). <strong> (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 25%)</strong> </li>
										<li>Based on your research, what business risks would you identify that the company may need to overcome. <strong>(Criticality weighted at 25%) </strong></li>
										<li>3.	Enumerate the technical and business risks and assumptions you have made for all three solutions. <strong>(Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 25%)</strong></li>
										
									</ol>

									<p><strong>Presentation and Structure of your work (weighted at 25%)</strong> includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading, correct use (and format) of citations and references.</p>
									<p><strong>Please note that appendices</strong> should not be used to extend the core report as reports should stand alone, complete and concise, without the appendices. They should really only be used if required, and only for supplementary and/ or supporting information. One key part of the exercises in this module is the need to be to be able to express ideas succinctly, concisely and with necessary brevity.</p>
									<p>It is recommended that most of these questions are addressed as bullet points to meet the word count requirement and the timeline can be expressed as a diagram or Gantt chart.  </p>
									<p>At the end of the week, you will also need to submit your peer assessment form, available in the Module Resources page.  Please see guidelines on the Department’s website  (Group/Teamwork). </p>

									<p><h5><strong>Checklist for the assignment</strong></h5><br><br>




									<ol>
										<li>Bulleted list of assumptions of company status, risk appetite, capabilities, and structure based on academic research (with citations);</li>
										<li>Bulleted list of key business risks (with references)</li>
										<li>Tabulated list of technical and business risks associated with each potential solution</li>
										<li>•	Remember to review your report with particular attention to spelling, structure, and formatting (proofreading is also a good approach as well).</li>
									</ol>

							<p><h5><strong>UNIT 5: Seminar 3 WIKI TASK</strong></h5><br><br>
							<strong>Wiki Development: Which Factor Will Most Affect the Future Direction of Information Risk Management?</strong><br><br>
								The last seminar (Unit 6) focuses on the development of the module wiki (Available in Module Resources) based on your answers from this Unit, as well as the answers created in next week’s seminar session. Please make sure you complete this activity in Unit 5/before Seminar 3.<br><br>
								You should create a minimum of two entries:<br><br>
								<ol>
								<li>titled "Risk Management Challenges", one based on a question chosen in this unit (see the questions below) from the Aven (2016) reading, and</li> 
								<li>titled "Risk and the NSA Hard Problems", one that answers the questions in the Seminar 3 preparation (Unit 6).</li></ol><br><br>
								Both should be supported with appropriate references. You are free to comment on each other’s wiki contribution.<br><br><br><br>
								<strong>Details</strong> <br><br>
								In the conclusion of his paper, Aven (2016) proposes several issues (reproduced below):<br><br>
								<ol>
								<li>“In intergenerational decision-making situations, what are the available<br>frameworks and perspectives to be taken? What are other options? When are different frameworks more appropriate than others? How do we capture the key knowledge issues and uncertainties of the present and future? What duty of care do we owe to future generations?</li>
								<li>How can we describe and represent the results of risk assessments in a way that is useful to decision-makers, which clearly presents the assumptions made and their justification with respect to the knowledge upon which the assessment is based?</li>
								<li>How can we display risk information without misrepresenting what we know and do not know?</li> 
								<li>How can we accurately represent and account for uncertainties in a way that properly justifies confidence in the risk results?</li> 
								<li>How can we state how good expert judgements are, and how can we improve them?</li> 
								<li>In the analysis of near misses, how should we structure the multi-dimensional space of causal proximity among different scenarios in order to measure ‘how near is a miss to an actual accident’</li></ol><br><br>
								Read the paper and then select one of the ‘issues’ listed above and propose an answer, based on the research around future trends presented in this unit.<br><br>

								<p ><strong> Assignment Brief:</strong><br> The next assessment in this module is the Risk Assessment report for the company described in Unit 3.  The aim of this deliverable is to apply the Information Risk Management techniques studied in the course to the problem as described and evaluate the results.  Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid (Module Resources). Ensure you review the feedback you have received on your work so far, particularly the Unit 3 submission, before submitting this assignment.

									<p>Your team brief as IT Risk Consultants is to: </p>
						<ol>
							<p>Create a comprehensive risk assessment and report, recommending which solution the company should select.</p> 
								<li>Select a risk assessment methodology to help with your analysis (the course discusses Open FAIR, CMU Octave, and the NIST framework, although others, including hybrids, exist as well). Justify your selection of framework with help from supporting literature – why does it suit this analysis? <strong> (Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%)
								</strong>
								</li>
								<li>Perform an analysis on the risks you identified in part one of the assessment, explaining for each risk whether you are using a qualitative or quantitative approach, and justifying your decision. <strong>(Criticality weighted at 10%)</strong>
								</li>
								<li>Produce a table listing the risks, weightings, and overall risk scores and whether you recommend they are avoided, retained, shared, reduced, or transferred. Also, list mitigation approaches for the retained, reduced, and shared risks. (Knowledge and <strong>Understanding weighted at 5%, Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%)</strong>
								</li>
								<li>Within your table, you are expected to justify your analysis with supporting evidence, based on a comprehensive cost-benefit approach. >strong>(Criticality weighted at 5%)</strong>
								</li>
						</ol>
															
							</p>


					<div>
						<p>Create a Disaster Recovery solution for whichever option you recommend. This solution should include:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>For the RPO/ RTO requirements you have decided to use, you should explain how you came to this decision, and the implications for the company. How does their risk appetite align with this decision? <strong>(Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%, Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 10%, Criticality weighted at 5%)</strong></li>
							<li>Your solution should include a high-level diagram that represents the approach you have selected. This should be at the level of function block representation – there is no need to discuss the number or type of servers, etc required. <strong>(Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%, Application of Knowledge and Understanding weighted at 5%)</strong></li>
							<li>How does your solution address the challenges of resilience, network security, and vendor provision/ lock-in (if appropriate)? <strong>(Criticality weighted at 5%)</strong></li>

						</ol>

						<p ><strong>Presentation:</strong><br></p>
						<p>Your report should be well presented, and at the very least, should use charts, graphs, tables, and formulae where necessary. Tables, graphs, careful labelling, and numbering are all well-established and effective presentation tools. If you put a table or a figure in your report, always describe it in the text. Result interpretation is necessary to enable the readers to understand the meanings of the numeric values. It is expected that you present your work in a report format, with appropriate formatting and section headings. It is also expected that you discuss your results, interpret them and reflect on them based on critical thinking in order to make it a high-quality work. Reference your work appropriately, wherever needed.   </p>
						<p> <strong>Presentation and Structure of your work (weighted at 25%)</strong> includes spelling, style, evidence of proofreading, correct use (and format) of citations and references.</p>

				Post by Jurbe Jubet<br><br>
				<!-- Hi Jurbe<br> thank you for your informative post<br> -->
				Spears & Barki (2010) wrote an article on User Participation in Information Systems 
				Security Risk Management(ISSRM) . The Article highlight the importance of involving 
				Users in Security Risk Management.<br><br>

				In the study, they used a multi-method approach with both Qualitative and Quantitative 
				assessment. The qualitative approach relied on interviewing users identified by an informant,
				 as participating in ISSRM activities and controls in their respective Organisations. 
				 The Qualitative assessment was then tested by a Quantitative method. The reason being 
				 that  combining qualitative and quantitative methods gave a better quality of results 
				 based on the ability to cross validate the accuracy of the qualitative assessment outcomes
				  with quantitative methods(Spears & Barki, 2010).  <br><br>

				  The writers observed that involving Users in security risk management created an avenue
				   for users to provide their expertise on how information is used in there day to day 
				   business activities. This helps management to understand how information is being used 
				   and where vulnerabilities lie, while also creating awareness to the users on the 
				   organization's risk tolerance, policies, and procedures. Also highlighted is that,
				    the more users are engaged in information system development, the more they perceive
					 it as personal and important. This creates better relationships with information 
					 security professionals and a better understanding of business needs(Spears & Barki, 2010).
					  <br><br>

					  Based on this report, it can be concluded that without effective user 
					  participation in ISSRM, there will be poor quality information (due to poor quality 
					  user feedback) used in risk assessment(Spears, 2006), thus impacting negatively on ISSRM.
						 <br><br>

						 I will use Quantitative approach and also rely on Historical data to 
						 create an initial assessment, and to develop matching probabilities(Sutton, 2021).
						  Incorporating historical data from similar research to test a recent task provides 
						  more data that will be used to assess risk and also gives a guide on the expected 
						  outcome for more accurate predictions.

				Hi Jurbe<br> thank you for your post<br>
				I agree with your conclusion that the user participation is an important factor when trying to determine a success of a Security Risk Management strategy.<br><br>

				Thank you for also sharing your approach you will use in preparing for the Unit 3 and 6 assignments. Our group has taken the approach of using historical data and information
				 available from similar sized organisations (SMEs) in a manufacturing businesses to build our assumptions
				  to allow us to perform risk analysis. <br><br>

				  That said, making assumptions about an organisation does not come without its disadvantages. The assumptions may fall short in predicting future business conditions which could create deviations with a large impact on the organisation (Khorsandi & Aven, 2017). This may in turn reduce the usefulness of the risk analysis performed. <br><br>

				  How do you think you could address these potential deviations from your initial assumptions to make the risk assessment more applicable? <br><br>

			I concur with your decision that the client cooperation is a significant variable while attempting to decide an outcome of a Security Risk Management technique. Much obliged to you for likewise sharing your methodology you will use in planning for the Unit 3 and 6 tasks. Our gathering has adopted the strategy of utilizing verifiable information and data accessible from comparative estimated associations (SMEs) in an assembling organizations to construct our suppositions to permit us to perform risk examination. All things considered, making suspicions about an association doesn't come without its weaknesses. The presumptions might miss the mark in foreseeing future business conditions which could make deviations with a huge effect on the association. This may thusly diminish the helpfulness of the gamble examination performed. How about you address these possible deviations from your underlying suspicions to make the gamble appraisal more pertinent.<br><br>

			Thank you Ags for this insight. I agree that assumptions based on historical data may introduce significant deviations that may impact on the organisations risk assessment. The limitation of this approach has been identified in this case, as due to lack of User access in risk assessment. However, an approach can be used to improve the quality of the assumptions and get a better risk Assessment outcome<br><br>

			(Khorsandi and Aven, 2017) suggest a framework which consist of 7 steps approach for evaluating the assumption deviation risk in Quality Risk Assessment (QRA), namely: <br><br>

			<ol>
				<li>Identifying the safety objectives for which the QRA aims to address/support.</li>
				<li>Identifying critical assumptions for which the results of the QRA are
					dependent upon, and parts of the QRA they affect.</li>
				<li> Identifying scenarios in which deviations in the assumptions identi-
					fied can lead to failures in meeting the established objectives.</li>
				<li>Assessing the likelihood of the assumption deviations leading to the
					unacceptable scenarios.</li>
				<li>Evaluating the strength of knowledge supporting the assessments.</li>
				<li>Evaluating the overall risk.</li>
				<li>Assessing assumption deviation risk with multiple assumptions
					(Khorsandi and Aven, 2017).
					</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The Approach aims to test the level of assumption deviation by way of identifying which assumptions are high risk or Low risk, while providing the decision makers with better options in selecting the preferred assumptions. It also gives decision makers more insight on which of the assumptions will need more information gathering, or more control requirements(Khorsandi and Aven, 2017). This way, I belive that deviations in assumptions based on historical data, will be better managed

			<li>Unrealistic Budgets - Although sometimes, because the risk is probably not known at the unset, there may be no money allocated to mitigate this risk (www.projectmanagement.com, N.D)</li>
			<li>Incomplete Requirements - the fact that over 60% of the requirements of the project cannot be itemised at the start of a project indicates a high degree of risk exposure(Hijazi et al, 20140)</li>
